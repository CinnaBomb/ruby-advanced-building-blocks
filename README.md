Built my own methods:

bubble_sort.rb takes an array and sorts it with the horrific bubble method. I made some optimizations to help it go a bit faster.

bubble_sort_by.rb takes an array and a block is passed to it so that the sorting method is specified.


Built my own module:

enumberable.rb is a module based on some methods in enumerable such as #each and #any?

Unfortunately, I'm not yet familar enough with RSpec to test with it so I've included commented tests for each method.

Still needs:
my_inject needs to take a symbol as an argument and invoke it as operator
